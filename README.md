# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

Using the statement below provided by google:

In general, logistic regression performs better when the number of noise variables is less than or equal to the number of explanatory variables and random forest has a higher true and false positive rate as the number of explanatory variables increases in a dataset.

The features are: 

loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number accounts, derogatory marks, total debt

I believe all of these values will contribute to a customer's loan status, so I would not expect much noise. However, we also don't have an enormous amount of variables, only 8. Going with the idea that Random Forests do better with more variables, I predict the Logistic Regression model will do better.
